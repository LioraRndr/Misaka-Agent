"""Last Order changes her node's cards while they run (GitHub issue #9).

Once accepted, a plan could not be changed: the ordinary card tools are the driver's in a research
node, and the Sisters created after the plan was read were never given a card. While a node's
research cards run, `misaka_research_cards` now records cards to add, unstarted cards to give to
another Sister and unstarted cards to cancel; it is checked as a plan's tasks are, and the driver
applies it at its next look at the cards."""
