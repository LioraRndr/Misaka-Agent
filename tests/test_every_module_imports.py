"""Every module of the package imports.

A module that is only imported lazily -- from inside a function, on the path that needs it -- fails
nowhere else, and no other test notices. Found 2026-09-29: the move of timeouts into settings.json
turned ``misaka.core.mcp.CALL_TIMEOUT`` and ``INIT_TIMEOUT`` into functions, the network MCP
transport and the MCP resource tools still imported the constants, and every HTTP/SSE MCP server
and every resource read would have failed at first use. The walk runs in a child process so that
importing everything leaves no state behind for the other tests."""
