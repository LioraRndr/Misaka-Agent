"""B126 (2026-10-02, r_8fef527ac2): the final red team sent her critique to Last Order before she
completed her card, and Last Order, between phases, edited the saved report draft by hand. The
draft's frozen digest no longer matched, the run failed at its last step with a partial report, and
every resume failed the same way. What the workflow saved is not the file tools' to change, and a
checkpoint changed anyway is put back from the command it was saved from."""
