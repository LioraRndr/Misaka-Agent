"""A message typed into an idle window must survive a turn that starts a moment later.

2026-09-23: in the research window the driver starts turns of its own (phase prompts,
notifications). handleInput saw an idle agent and handed the text to the input loop; by the time
the loop called prompt() a driver turn was streaming, prompt() raised "Agent is already
processing. Specify streamingBehavior ..." and the text was gone. The loop now asks for the same
steer that Enter would have queued had it seen the turn."""
