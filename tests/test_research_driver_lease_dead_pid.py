"""A driver that died hard (a crashed pane, SIGKILL) leaves its lease behind, and until the
300 s TTL ran out `/research resume` was refused as "already being driven" (2026-09-23 23:41,
three refusals, cleared by hand in the database). A lease whose lock names this host and a
pid that no longer exists is taken over at once; a live pid, a foreign host and a lock that
does not name a process still wait for the TTL."""
