"""Write the sample home a release leaves on a user's machine, for tests/test_upgrade_from_releases.py.

    .venv/bin/python tests/fixtures/homes/make_home.py 0.18.0

Run it at the release commit, with that release's code: what it writes is what a user of that
release has on disk (a board with a card and a finished research run, a queued message, a
conversation, settings, a Sister, a project), and every later build must open it. That is the
release gate of docs/plans/upgrade-install-uninstall-2026-09-29.md. Until a release is tagged,
regenerating its sample is how a format change made before the release is recorded; after it,
a format change ships its migration instead, and the sample never changes again.
