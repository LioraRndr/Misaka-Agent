"""The halt path settles for real: a card accepted with a genuine submission (digests recorded by
``dispatch.accept_state``) is registered as a research artifact before the partial report is
written when the driver is interrupted, and the report lists it. The lifecycle fixture mocks
settle away; this test puts the real one back and checks the database, not a recorder."""
