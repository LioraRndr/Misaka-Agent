# Commands

There are two kinds of command. **Terminal commands** start with `misaka` and are typed in your
shell. **Chat commands** start with `/` and are typed in a chat window, where `/` on its own
lists them all.

`misaka COMMAND --help` shows every option of a terminal command.

## Terminal commands

### Starting and chatting

| `misaka uninstall --data` | remove your data and keep the program |

program once it has exited.
