# Models

Every agent needs a model to think with. This page covers signing in to a provider, choosing
which model each agent uses, and running a model on your own machine.

## Signing in

**Through the browser.** Sign in with an account you already have: ChatGPT Plus or Pro, GitHub
Copilot, xAI (a Grok or X subscription), OpenRouter, Kimi Code and a few others. A Claude account
signs in the same way; Anthropic bills that use per token as extra usage, outside your plan's
limits.

**With an API key**, billed per use: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, OpenRouter, xAI,
DeepSeek and many more. Amazon Bedrock uses your AWS credentials instead.

| Where | How |
|---|---|
| in chat | `/login` asks whether you use a subscription or an API key, then lists the providers for it. `/login PROVIDER` goes straight to one. |
| in the terminal | `misaka setup model` |
| sign out | `/logout` |

Sign-ins are stored in `~/.misaka/credentials/auth.json`, readable only by you.

A key in your shell, or in `~/.misaka/.env`, is picked up without signing in (the shell's wins):

| Provider | Variable |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Mistral | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| xAI | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Amazon Bedrock | your AWS settings, such as `AWS_PROFILE` |

`misaka auth check` shows which providers are ready, without sending a request.

## Choosing who uses which model

There is one default model for the whole team, and each agent can have her own instead.

| To | Do this |
|---|---|
| set the team's default | `misaka setup model`, and choose "Global default" |
| give Last Order her own model | in her window: `/model`, highlight a model, press Ctrl+S. Or `misaka setup model`, and choose her. |
| give a Sister her own model | in her window (`/sister 10032`): `/model`, then Ctrl+S. Or when creating her: `misaka create 10036 --model provider/model` |
| switch model for this conversation only | `/model`, then Enter. Or `/model NAME` |
| cycle through your favourite models | Ctrl+P. `/scoped-models` chooses which models are in the cycle |

A team can mix providers. A common arrangement is a strong model for Last Order, who plans and
writes the conclusions, and cheaper ones for Sisters who do the reading.

## Thinking levels

Models that reason before answering take a thinking level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, `xhigh` or `max`, as far as the model supports them. Higher levels are slower and cost
more.

| To | Do this |
|---|---|
| change it for this conversation | `/thinking LEVEL`, or Shift+Tab to cycle |
| make it this agent's default | `/thinking --default LEVEL` in her window |
| set it for a new Sister | `misaka create 10036 --thinking high` |

## A model on your own machine

### llama.cpp

MISAKA works with a [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) server directly. Start the
server, then type `/login llama.cpp` in chat and give its address (Enter keeps
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`). You can instead set `LLAMA_BASE_URL`, and `LLAMA_API_KEY` if your
server wants a key. The server's models then appear in `/model` as `llama.cpp/NAME`.

`/llama` in chat manages the server's models: load and unload them, or search Hugging Face for a
model and have the server download it (this needs a server started in router mode, and
`HF_TOKEN` for gated models). This needs the `openai` extra, which `providers` includes.

### Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM and others

Any server that speaks the OpenAI API can be added: Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or a gateway your
institution runs. Describe it in `~/.misaka/models.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "ollama": {
      "baseUrl": "http://localhost:11434/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "ollama",
      "models": [
        { "id": "qwen3:32b", "contextWindow": 32768, "maxTokens": 8192 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `baseUrl` | where the server listens |
| `api` | the protocol: `openai-completions` for OpenAI-compatible servers, `anthropic-messages` for Anthropic-compatible ones. It can also be set per model. |
| `apiKey` | the key to send; local servers usually accept any text. `$NAME` reads it from an environment variable, and `!command` from a command's output. |
| `models[].id` | the model's name as the server knows it |
| `contextWindow`, `maxTokens` | the model's limits, in tokens; 128000 and 16384 when left out |

The model then appears in `/model` as `ollama/qwen3:32b`.

Research asks a lot of a model: long contexts, many tool calls, careful reading. Small local
models often struggle with it. A workable arrangement is a hosted model for Last Order and local
ones for some Sisters.

## Several models answering as one

`misaka moa configure` sets up a Mixture-of-Agents preset: several models answer the same prompt
and one combines their answers. The preset appears in `/model` like any other model once the
combining model's provider is signed in. `misaka moa list` shows your presets, and
`misaka moa delete NAME` removes one.

## When a model does not work

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| `No API key found for ...` | Sign in with `/login`, or set the provider's key. |
| `The ... package is not installed` | The provider's SDK is missing. Reinstall with the `providers` extra: see [Getting started](../getting-started.md#2-install-misaka). |
| the wizard says the test request failed | The key is stored, but the provider refused it. Check the key and run `misaka setup model` again. |
| `Invalid models.json ...` | The file has a mistake, and the message names it. A custom provider needs `baseUrl`, `apiKey` and an `api`. |
