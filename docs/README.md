## Words you will meet

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Last Order** | the coordinator. You talk to her; she plans the research, hands out the work and writes the conclusions. |
| **Sister** | a specialist agent you create, known by an ID such as `10032`. Each has her own specialty and skills, and can have her own model. |
| **ally** | another vendor's agent (Claude Code, Codex) that takes work from Last Order the way a Sister does. |
| **card** | one assignment for one Sister (or ally), written as a Markdown file in the project's `cards/` folder. |
| **board** | the list of the project's cards, with their status (`/board`). |
| **research run** | everything that happens for one question, from the first plan to the final report. |
| **node** | one piece of research inside a run: your question itself, or an alternative that an earlier node passed over, researched on its own. Each node has its own plan, conclusion and review. |
| **red team** | the Sister who challenges a node's conclusion, then reads it again for the possibilities it did not take and the gaps it left. Last Order has to answer every objection. |
| **research graph** | the nodes of a run and how they connect: which node opened which, which were joined, and how their conclusions relate. `final/<run>-graph.md` draws it. |
| **project** | the folder you run MISAKA in. Research output is written there. |
| **home** | `~/.misaka/` (or `MISAKA_HOME`), where MISAKA keeps your settings, Sisters, credentials and history. |
| **panel** | the terminal interface that opens when you type `misaka`: Last Order's window with the agents' panes beside it. `ctrl+b` then `?` lists its keys; [the panel guide](guide/panel.md) explains it. |
