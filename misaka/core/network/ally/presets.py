"""The allies misaka can drive over ACP, and which of them this home enables.

A preset is shipped only once its agent has been driven end to end -- a real turn, its tool
calls rendered, context held across two prompts, a session resumed from a fresh process --
because a roster entry that cannot run a task is worse than none: the model reads it as
available (the rule raven's presets follow). Claude Code and Codex are the two measured here.

Both are reached through the ACP project's adapters, fetched with ``npx -y`` at a pinned
version: an adapter is plumbing in front of an agent, holds no credential of its own, and an
unpinned ``npx -y`` would change which build runs without anyone choosing it. Each adapter
bundles its agent and uses the login this machine already has. Pins follow raven's
measurement of 2026-09-23 (claude-agent-acp 0.81.1 bundles Claude Code 2.1.280; codex-acp
1.13.1 bundles codex 0.156.1); a bump is a deliberate change here.

``settings.json``'s ``allies`` is a map from an ally's name to ``{}`` (the preset of that name)
or to ``{"command": [...], "env": {...}, "description": "..."}`` for any other ACP agent.
