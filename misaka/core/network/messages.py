"""Persistent direct messages between the sessions of Last Order and the Sisters.

Every message has exactly one recipient, fixed when it is sent (``resolve_address``):

* a card id -- ``t_1a2b3c`` -- is the session running that card, at that attempt;
* a session id -- ``01a0b19c-...`` -- is that one conversation;
* a name -- ``last-order``, ``10032`` -- is the one live session of that role in the sender's
  panel space. With none there, the message waits for the role's contact session
  (``misaka dm``), which is woken for it; with several, it is refused and they are named.

A row carries its recipient: ``to_task`` (with ``generation``) or ``to_session``. A row with
neither is for the role's contact session, the only reader of such rows. The delivery model is
Hermes' Bot Mode DM (``misaka/cli/dm.py``); the tool's name and schema are CCB's SendMessage.
