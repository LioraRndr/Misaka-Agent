"""Context packets for the Last Order of every node below the root.

Every artifact and session stays addressable at its recorded path; this compact map locates
them. A node with a single parent is a fork of that parent's conversation and already holds it;
a join is a fork of the lowest node its parents share, so for its parents' own work the packet is
its brief: each parent listed on its own -- question, conclusions, critiques, what its Last Order
did with each issue, the decisions it made -- never merged into one account.
