The run's own products -- every conclusion, critique, divergence review, plan and card

book. The prompt itself carries a catalog of ids, never the texts: twenty nodes' texts came to
2.3 MB, which compacted the turn before its instructions were read and left a two-line reply

red team's objections and what Last Order did with each, the corrections recorded against it; the divergence review's
proposals and the decisions taken; and what its children and any join that carried it forward found. Include competing
interpretations and uncertainty. Statuses and dispositions describe execution, not truth. Preserve the node's
definitions, premises and conditions; make its differences from other nodes visible without resolving them.
Do not vote, rank nodes or adjudicate the original question here. Where reading this node beside the others shows
a connection the graph does not record -- paths converging or diverging, a node resonating with, appropriating or
displacing another -- record it with `misaka_research_relate`; relations join the graph the report reads.
Begin the section with a heading naming the node.
"""

DRAFT_CONTRACT = """# Report draft — not delivered; awaiting independent red-team review
Draft the answer to the original research question. The planning-stage prohibition on answering
is lifted. This is a working draft: an independent red team reviews it before you adjudicate its objections. The
survey is your map of every line of inquiry, one section each: read it whole first (`doc_outline` lists its
sections), then the conclusions and critiques it points to, and the sources behind them, where the answer turns on them.
The ledger records declarations, not machine-certified truths.

## What this stage is
The research has formed its conclusions; this stage brings them to articulation. Draw the article's theses,
arguments and connections out of the run's materials -- the lines' conclusions, what each revised, rebutted or
conceded under critique, the decisions, joins and relations between them, the errata -- and argue every connection
you draw from them, including those the graph does not record. Judge as a scholar judges a body of evidence: whether
claims are supported, whether findings bear on one another, whether positions can be reconciled. Do not overturn or
reweigh a line's conclusion on your own authority; that takes evidence, disclosed as retrieved here. Keep what the
research established distinct in the prose from what the article infers in bringing it together.

## The materials and what you already know
The materials may hold knowledge you lack and positions far from received opinion. Divergence from consensus is not
an error: do not normalise such positions or soften them toward the mainstream. Nor is a claim true for being in the
materials. Use what you know as a check on facts -- dates, figures, names, attributions, whether a work exists -- not
as a verdict on interpretations. Where the materials and what you know conflict on a fact, verify it against sources;
if it cannot be settled, state the conflict rather than choose silently. Background knowledge that informs the
exposition is marked as such and cites no work the run did not read.

## Integration
Integrate; do not catalogue. Build the argument from how the findings bear on one another -- how a line answers the
conclusion it departed from, how a join confronted its parents, where lines converge, diverge or displace one
another, which evidence and premises they share -- so that each finding does work in the argument instead of
standing in a list of results. Where premises are irreconcilable, keep the positions distinct and state precisely
where and why they part: do not average them, and do not present incompatible claims as jointly true.

## The reader and the form
Write for a reader of the humanities and social sciences: a research article in the language of the question, argued
rather than narrated -- organized by the question and its argument, not by how the research was run. A title, an
abstract and keywords; an introduction that states the question, the concepts it turns on, and the research design and
materials in scholarly terms; chapters that argue; a conclusion. Prose in paragraphs; lists and tables only where a
comparison needs them.
The body carries no run vocabulary or identifiers -- nodes, cards, rounds, the red team, dispositions, their ids, file
paths. Name a line of inquiry by what it argued and a source by its author and title.
Every line's final conclusion has its place in the argument -- as a finding, an objection, a qualification or a rival
reading. What the run produced and read is the article's material: none of it is dropped for being inconvenient.

## The apparatus, where traceability lives
- Notes cite author, title, year and page or section; a primary source names its edition or archive; what the research
  read only at second hand is cited as quoted in its source. A local file or `doc:` locator may follow in the note.
- The bibliography lists every work the article cites: primary sources, scholarship, web and database material.
- Appendix I, the lines of inquiry: every node of the catalog, one row each -- its question in plain words, its
  conclusion in a sentence, where the body takes it up, and its id. A line that reached no conclusion says so.
- Appendix II, the record: the costs the answer accepts (the conceded issues); the corrections recorded against
  conclusions (errata), each applied in the body; the paths not taken, each with its reason (options not opened,
  proposals declined, nodes skipped); what stays open (parked and unanswered issues); where independent lines converge
  and where they diverge.
- Appendix III, the materials: one line naming misaka's complete list of everything the run opened and downloaded,
  given under the catalog below. Do not copy it.

## Judgement
Do not vote or let a majority erase a minority view. Distinguish empirical claims, causal explanations, interpretations,
and normative premises. Where lines disagree, examine differences in definitions, scope, period and method before
judging whether the disagreement is real; resolve it only where the evidence decides it, and otherwise keep it
standing. Give a direct answer grounded in the research -- conditional on its premises where lines rest on different
ones -- with the strongest competing accounts, evidentiary limits, unresolved questions, and what would change the
answer. Depth limits describe execution, not whether an objection is correct. Distinguish independent
support from repeated reliance on the same sources or premises; retain material qualifications and counterevidence when
combining conclusions. Read relevant available Skills when useful for these checks.
Where the research showed a question rests on a confusion or an ideological presupposition, give the dissolution -- a
legitimate result, not a failure to answer. A dissolution of the research question itself is the answer only if the
user agreed to it (`dissolution_consent` in the record); if they did not, answer the question as asked and give the
dissolution as one reading, with its grounds.

## Retrieval
You may retrieve material needed to verify or compare the submitted evidence; preserve it in the workspace and identify
its source and path so the red team can read it. Evidence retrieved here that changes a line's conclusion is disclosed
as such, so the red team can weigh it. Do not turn this draft into an undisclosed new research assignment;
identify substantial unfilled evidence needs as limits. Do not force interpretation or normative reasoning into a
verbatim quotation. Do not hide corrections or unsupported leaps behind reference markers.
""" + planner.SOURCES_FOOTER

FINAL_CONTRACT = """# Final report — adjudicate the independent review of the draft
Adjudicate the independent red team's review of the saved report draft. The planning-stage prohibition on answering is
lifted. Read the full draft, the review, and the sources relevant to each objection. Criticism is not a verdict: accept,
reject, or retain disagreement on each substantive objection, explaining why. The measure is fidelity to the research
and to the evidence, not a prior view of the question. A missing source, interpretive conflict,
or normative disagreement is not automatically a factual error. Do not rank views by vote or authority. After accepting
a correction, recheck affected passages and the conclusion; preserve independently supported content.

Write the complete final report in the draft's form -- a research article for a reader of the humanities and social
sciences, its body free of run vocabulary and identifiers, its notes, bibliography and Appendices I-III as the draft
has them -- revised where the review holds, completed where it found a line of inquiry missing. Add Appendix IV, the
review: which objections changed the answer, which you rejected and why, which remain unsettled. You may consult

Read the whole draft, the survey (`{survey['path']}`), node critiques and full sources

document -- `doc_outline`, `doc_read` and `doc_find` read them by the ids in the catalog below, and each node's
`sources_manifest` lists the rest of its folder.
Inspect quotations and attribution in context, reasoning, causal and conceptual claims, methods, omissions,
competing interpretations and normative premises. Check the facts the answer rests on against sources of your own.
Do not infer that a claim is false merely because a number or wording is absent from a short excerpt. Your own
objections also require reasons and may be wrong. Where relevant, trace cross-branch concept drift or shared
unsupported premises to the affected draft passages. Compare the draft against node records for lost qualifications,
counterevidence or conflated explanations; read relevant available Skills as needed.
Check fidelity: every thesis, argument and connection is argued from the run's materials or from evidence retrieved
and disclosed here. Flag conclusions overturned or reweighed without such evidence; positions normalised toward
received opinion; doubtful facts accepted for being in the materials; background knowledge presented as the run's
finding or cited to a work the run did not read; lines catalogued where their findings bear on one another;
incompatible positions merged or presented as jointly true.
Check completeness against the catalog below: Appendix I lists every node, and each line's final conclusion is argued
in the body, not only listed; a line missing from either, or a conclusion the body misstates, is a material issue.
Check the form: the body is written for a reader -- run vocabulary, ids and file paths belong in the notes and appendices.
You may search/read supplementary sources; preserve and locate anything you use. Do not edit the draft.

## deliverable
`critique.md`
Write it under your card's deliverable directory. For each objection identify the draft passage,
source/context, reasoning, and a suggested correction or an explicit unresolved disagreement.
Call `misaka_card_note` with your complete `issues` list (kind, question, rationale, priority, material).
Use issues=[] explicitly if none. The root Last Order will adjudicate this review; no new research branches
are created from it and material=true is not an automatic verdict.
