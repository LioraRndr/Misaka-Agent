"""What a research run spent: tokens and money, by the conversations that spent them.

2026-10-07 (GitHub issue #9): a run's spending could not be seen anywhere. The board's ledger
counts tokens against the cap (``budget_usage`` rows, a total each); what a call cost is kept
where Pi keeps it, on each assistant message's ``usage.cost`` in the session file. A run's
conversations are its root Last Order's (her window, from the run's start), every other folder
the run opened in the session store (each node's Last Order, a command-line root), and each of
its cards' session folders, every attempt and subagent included.
