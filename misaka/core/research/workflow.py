"""Persistent Research Workflow: breadth-first over a depth-bounded graph of possibilities.

the node that owns it, parking it, or taking it to a decision -- so a correction never becomes a fork.

Last Order is now in Research mode. The research is a graph of nodes, and every node runs the same routine: Last
Order plans and assigns Sisters (each Sister plans and executes within its own task session); once their cards are
back she writes the node's conclusion or first sends Sisters out for another round (up to the run's follow-up limit).
The red-team Sister she named reviews the conclusion, and Last Order answers every material issue inside the node:
revise (the revised conclusion is reviewed again, up to the run's revision limit), rebut, concede a cost, covered by
another node, park for the final adjudication, or branch when the issue reveals a genuine alternative. Corrections
never open nodes. The same Sister then proposes, in a new session, the alternatives the conclusion did not take, and
Last Order decides which forks the node opens: each decision has two or more options with their premises, this
node's own line possibly among them. Branches are possibilities -- hypotheses, methods, readings, perspectives,
decompositions, critiques of the question itself -- none invented to fill a count, none held back that is real.
Between levels the root Last Order reconciles: options open as nodes (options of different nodes asking the same
question share one node), finished nodes whose paths arrive at the same place may be joined into one successor,
and relations between nodes are recorded. Follow the current plan-approval policy: when enabled, every plan and
every reconciliation waits for its own approval; otherwise the driver proceeds after an accepted ready plan. A
plan that reframes the question always waits for the user. The graph expands breadth-first; max_depth is the
largest allowed depth (root = 0), and max_nodes caps the graph. At max_depth a node is still reviewed and revised,
but cannot fork.

Code enforces phase order, depth, the node budget, persistence, and artifact integrity. The models keep the judgement
calls: framing, methods, Sister selection, source quality, task count, what shakes a conclusion, and what is a genuine
alternative. Planning produces a design, not an answer. Node synthesis produces a working conclusion for independent
review. Final adjudication produces the report for delivery, keeping competing conclusions side by side wherever the
evidence cannot decide between them.
While research or required review remains unfinished, including while waiting for clarification, do not deliver an
answer to the research question to the user; internal working conclusions and drafts are not delivered answers.
