# -- decoding text that is not UTF-8 --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Strictly, or not at all. Text files used to be opened with errors='replace', which never fails
# and never says so: a Shift-JIS 青空文庫 book and a GB18030 file both entered the corpus as pages
# of '��y�͔L�ł���', and passed the text check because replacement characters are characters.
# Everything downstream -- doc_find, doc_verify, the ledger's quote check -- then operated on
# garbage in silence, and a ledger that "verifies" a quotation against mojibake is worse than one
# that cannot read the book at all.
#
# The order below is not the obvious one, and the reason is measured rather than theoretical.
# These encodings are not mutually exclusive: decoding one language's bytes under another's codec
# usually *succeeds*. Measured on a paragraph of each (the fixtures in
# tests/test_documents_encoding.py):
#
#   bytes \ codec   cp932       cp949            gb18030             cp950
#   Japanese        correct     refuses          clean, wrong Han    refuses
#   Korean          refuses     correct          clean, wrong Han    refuses
#   Chinese         refuses     Hangul/Han mix   correct             clean, wrong Han
#   Big5            refuses     refuses          private-use junk    correct
#
# So first-clean-wins is only as honest as its order, and no order suffices on its own: cp950
# accepts Chinese and gb18030 accepts Big5, so "must be tried first" has a cycle. Ordering does
# the work it can (cp932 is the pickiest and goes first; gb18030 accepts nearly any byte stream
# and goes late), and the coherence rule below catches the two mis-decodes that would otherwise
# win their slot.
#
# The codecs are the vendor supersets, not the bare standards, because the supersets are what the
# files are actually written in. Python's ``shift_jis`` is JIS X 0208 and *rejects* the NEC/IBM
# extension rows -- ① № Ⅰ ㈱ ℡ ㍉ 髙 﨑 -- which is to say it rejects what Japanese Windows and
# 青空文庫 write; the decode then fell through to gb18030, which accepts nearly anything, and a
# Japanese book entered the corpus as mojibake that the ledger would later "verify" quotations
# against. Each swap was checked exhaustively over the whole one- and two-byte space (the codecs
# are two-byte, so that is all of them) and each wide codec accepts every sequence its narrow one
# accepts -- zero new rejections. They disagree on 6 sequences (shift_jis/cp932), 0 (euc_kr/cp949)
# and 11 (big5/cp950), and every disagreement is the vendor variant of one glyph (wave dash vs.
# fullwidth tilde, ¢ vs. ￠), never a different character. big5hkscs was rejected for this: it
# reassigns 249 sequences in the ETen kana rows to HKSCS characters, so it is not a superset.
# tests/test_documents_encoding.py re-runs that check.
#
# Character *frequency* cannot help, however tempting: two two-byte codecs over the same bytes
# give the same frequency profile, only different characters. Telling rare Han from common Han
# needs a per-language character table -- that is a charset detector, and this is not one.

# 6-7, KS X 1001, GB 2312 all carry them), arrows and mathematical operators, the enclosed and
# squared forms 青空文庫 and Japanese Windows are full of (① ㈱ ㍉ Ⅰ), box drawing and the
# geometric shapes that rule a Japanese table (■ ● ★), Bopomofo, radicals, CJK punctuation and
# forms, kana, Hangul, Han.
#
# Running that census over every one- and two-byte sequence of all four codecs leaves the private
# use areas as essentially the only thing outside these ranges -- which is the point. Private use
# is what a wrong codec produces, and control bytes are what any codec produces from a file that
# is not text. Big5 read as GB18030 is still 39% outside, eight times the rule's bar.

    """How much of a decode is evidence that the codec was wrong -- the share of the sample that
    only a wrong codec produces, ``0.0`` for a decode that reads as writing throughout -- or
    ``None`` when it is not writing at all and has to be refused outright.

    Refusal comes first. One rule holds for every decode, UTF-8 included:

    0. a NUL is not a character in any document. It is a valid UTF-8 *byte*, though, so a BOM-less
       UTF-16LE stream of Latin text decodes as UTF-8 without an error and enters the corpus with
       every second character a NUL. Self-validating means the bytes are well-formed UTF-8, not
       that the file was UTF-8.

    The other three apply only to a legacy CJK codec (``cjk_codec``), because they are measured
    against the table above -- the character ranges *those* encodings can express. A UTF-8 file is
    not a guess and must not be judged by that table: Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Devanagari and
    emoji are all outside it, and a Russian book is not incoherent.

    1. more than 5% of the sample outside the ranges of written text -- Big5 read as GB18030 is
       39% private-use characters, and a binary file read as anything is mostly control bytes;
    2. CJK characters that stand alone rather than in runs. This is the one that catches a wrong
       codec over mostly-ASCII text, where rule 1 sees almost nothing: Latin-1 Swedish read as
       GB18030 comes out 'H鋜 鋜 gudarnas 鋘gar' -- 13% of the sample, no private-use characters,
       and 100% of the non-ASCII tail is Han, so counting the tail cannot separate it either. What
       separates it is that every one of those Han characters is alone between ASCII letters,
       because each accented byte ate the letter after it. Measured as the fraction of CJK
       characters with a CJK neighbour: Japanese 1.00, Chinese 1.00, Big5 1.00, Korean 0.97, a
       Shift-JIS README that is 88% ASCII 1.00, an all-citations Japanese file (every character
       between digits, the worst real case) 0.50 -- against 0.00 for Swedish under cp932, gb18030
       and cp950 alike. The bar is half, and a sample that is majority CJK is exempt outright, so
       no real CJK book can ever be turned away by this rule;
    3. Hangul beside kana or beside Han, either one in bulk -- Chinese read as EUC-KR comes out
       58% Hangul and 42% Han, while Korean prose is Hangul with hanja as a garnish. The threshold
       is a fifth for both, which admits ordinary hanja and the Japanese terms Korean scholarship
       on Japan quotes in kana -- KS X 1001 encodes kana, and a bare truthiness test on it handed
       correct EUC-KR documents to GB18030 over a single quoted word.

    A decode that survives all four is still only a candidate, because these encodings overlap:
    the same bytes read as two of them can both come out looking like writing, and the loser is
    then decided by whichever codec ``TEXT_ENCODINGS`` happens to try first. So what is left is
    counted rather than refused -- every character that only a wrong codec would have produced:

    4. private-use characters, the same ones rule 1 counts. Under the 5% bar they were free; two
       of them in a seven-character sample are not, and that is exactly what Big5 read as GB18030
       looks like: '第一章 緒論。' comes out as '材?彻 狐阶?' with a U+E5E6 and a U+E4C9
       standing where the '?' are. This is the only signal that sees the wrong-Han-for-Han theft
       at all: the rest of that output *is* ordinary Han in U+4E00-9FFF, so no rule about what
       CJK looks like can tell it from the real thing;
    5. half-width kana in a decode that also holds full-width script or private use. Real writing
       does not mix them in that proportion -- a legacy half-width file is half-width throughout,
       and a modern Japanese document that quotes half-width kana is full-width throughout. A
       Chinese or Korean sentence read as cp932 is 73%-91% half-width kana studded with a few
       stray Han, which is neither;
    6. a character standing where its own script never puts it. Two of those are worth counting:
       a kana modifier on a base that cannot take it (see ``_KANA_DAKUTEN`` above), which is what
       is left for the half-width file that carries no other script at all and where rule 5 is
       blind by construction -- it is what keeps genuine half-width Japanese decodable instead of
       refused and handed to GB18030 as a wall of Han; and a Han character immediately behind a
       hangul syllable, which is how Chinese read as cp949 gives itself away when it comes out
       mostly hangul and rule 3 therefore says nothing.

    What it does not catch, written down rather than papered over: a file too short to carry the
    evidence (a fragment of two or three characters is decided by codec order and nothing else), a
    BOM-less UTF-16 file whose text is CJK (its bytes carry no NULs), a two-byte sequence that is
    also valid UTF-8 ('为 none' in GB18030 is), and a Korean document in heavy 국한문혼용 (a fifth
    or more hanja), which rule 3 turns away and GB18030 then reads as Han. Those cases buy correct
    Simplified Chinese and correct modern Korean, which are the common ones; ``meta['encoding']``
    records the choice on every document, so a reader who sees the wrong one can convert the file
    and re-ingest.

# -- EPUB ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An EPUB is a zip holding XHTML chapters plus a package document that says which of them the
# book consists of and in what order. Reading it means reading those three things -- the
# container, the package document, the spine -- with the standard library and nothing else.
#
# Every member is read by the name the package document gives, out of the archive; nothing is
# ever extracted to a path. A crafted href of "../../etc/passwd" is therefore a lookup that
# misses, not a file on this machine.

# An archive member declares its uncompressed size in the central directory, so a "book" that
# would decompress to a gigabyte is skipped before it is read -- an EPUB now also arrives by
# download and is indexed on arrival, and the reader that opens whatever it is handed is the
# one that gets handed a zip bomb. 16 MiB is several million words of XHTML; a chapter that
# large is not a chapter.
_EPUB_MEMBER_BYTES = 16 * 1024 * 1024

# The member cap bounds one chapter; these bound the book, which is the number an archive can
# multiply. Many manifest items may share one href and the spine may list them all, so a ~250 KB
# archive holding a single 1 MB member can name it a thousand times: deduplication below removes
# that amplification, and these two are what remains true when the members are all distinct.
#
# 16 Mi characters is the whole book's markup, counted as it is decoded. Every codec here yields
# at most one character per byte read, so it bounds the decompression too, and markup is a third
# to a half of a chapter file -- so this is roughly a ten-million-character book. War and Peace is
# 3.2M characters and the complete Shakespeare 5.5M: the ceiling holds either one twice over, and
# a "book" that does not fit is not one. 10,000 spine entries is the same judgement about work
# rather than memory: one archive read each, and a page-per-file scan of a 1,000-page book uses a
# tenth of it.
