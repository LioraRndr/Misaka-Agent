"""A picture answered in words, for a model that cannot see it.

The image goes to the vision model the user named (``provider/model``) with a question, and the
answer comes back as text. There is one such model for the whole system, ``vision.model`` in
settings.json -- not one per role, the way a Sister's chat model is chosen -- because the job is
the same for every role. ``browser.vision_model``, which named it for the browser alone before,
is read when it is not set. The browser asks it about a screenshot; the ``vision`` extension has
it read every image in a request to a model without vision. FrontierAgent's reader works the
same way through its READDOC_VISION_* gateway, and its transcription prompt is used here.
