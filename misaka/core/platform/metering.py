"""Every model request a metered session makes, leased against ``research.token_cap`` and recorded.

All of them pass one point: the provider registry (``misaka.ai.api_registry``) -- the agent's
own turns, compaction summaries, the vision bridge, MoA's member calls, LCM's summaries, the cache
warmer. :func:`install` puts :func:`meter` there. A request finds the ledger it is billed to
(``budget.ledger``: the window turn's usage context, else the ``MISAKA_USAGE_*`` environment of a
card, node or sub-agent process); with none it passes through untouched, as a plain chat does.

Billed, it leases its worst case -- the context's upper bound, the output it may write, and the
thinking an adapter asks for beyond that (``thinking_allowance``) -- waits while other requests in
flight fill the cap, stops with ``budget.EXHAUSTED_MESSAGE`` when spending already has, sends with
``maxTokens`` cut to the lease, and records what it used when it ends. Reasoning is left as the
caller asked: the lease pays for it. 2026-10-07 (issue #10 plan, token_cap): a run used to get one
fixed 32,768-token slice for its whole life, smaller than one research request, and only the
session's own turns were bounded at all.
