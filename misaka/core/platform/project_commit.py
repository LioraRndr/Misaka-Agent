"""Committing the project to git, only when the user asks and only after the user confirms.

Nothing in MISAKA commits by itself: research, cards and their files leave the working tree as
it is, and the history is the user's to write. Two doors lead to a commit, both in a window the
user is sitting at: the ``/commit`` command, and the ``project_commit`` tool Last Order (or a
Sister chatting with the user) calls when the user asks in words. Either way the files that would
be committed are shown and the user presses confirm; a session with no screen cannot commit. The
tool exists only in foreground sessions that are not research nodes, and a research phase turn
narrows the tools to the research set, so no phase of a run can reach it. The commit is made
under the repository's own configured identity.
