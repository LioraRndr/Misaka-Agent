"""The coverage check for research designs: the ``coverage-maps`` skill (maps of fields,
facets, kinds of question and traditions, read on demand) and ``coverage_scan`` (where a
question actually lives in the literature: OpenAlex, facet by facet), so a plan is checked
against more than the planner's memory. Every role, including the resident headless sessions
used by Research.

The maps ship here rather than as a skill to install: the scan is step 0 of the maps'
procedure, and a separately installed copy could go missing while the scan stayed loaded,
leaving half a check. A field's own maps are a skill of their own in the project's
``skills/``; a ``coverage-maps`` copy left in a skill layer by an older install is listed
beside this one and answers to the unprefixed name."""
