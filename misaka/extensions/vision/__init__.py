"""Images for a model that cannot see them, read to it by the one vision model the user named.

Pi keeps every image in the session as it arrived and decides per request what a model is sent:
``transformMessages`` puts "(image omitted: model does not support images)" in an image's place
for a model whose ``input`` has no "image". This extension runs before that, on the request-time
``context`` event, and for such a model puts what the vision model (``vision.model``, see
:mod:`misaka.core.web.vision`) reads off the image in its place instead. Every image a request
carries is covered the same way -- one the user pasted, a page from doc_page_image, an image
file from read, a screenshot, a picture an MCP tool returned -- so no tool reads images to a
model on its own. A model that can see is sent the image itself, untouched; the session keeps
the pixels either way, so a switch to a model that sees brings them back. Nothing in Pi's kernel
is changed for it.

An image is read once: what the vision model read is kept by the image's hash (the home's
``vision_cache``), and every later request that carries the same image takes it from there.
