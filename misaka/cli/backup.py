"""Copies of the home taken before something could lose it: ``misaka update`` and ``misaka uninstall``.

Hermes takes the same two (the pre-update snapshot, and ``hermes backup`` before data is deleted):
before an update, a quick copy of what a person could not recreate, kept inside the home and
bounded in number; before the home is removed, one archive of all of it, kept outside. A SQLite
file is copied through SQLite's own backup, so a board another process is writing is copied
whole rather than torn.
