"""``python -m misaka.cli.subagent_child``: the sub-agent child process.

The runtime (``misaka.core.subagent.runtime``) starts every child with this module so the
process goes through the same entry wiring as the CLI does -- the bundled extensions a
child needs (its parent's provider may be one of them) are composed in by
``misaka.cli.bootstrap``, which core cannot do for itself.
