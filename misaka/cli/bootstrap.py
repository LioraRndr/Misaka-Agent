"""What a process entry wires before any session is built.

Pi's ``main.ts`` composes its bundled extensions ahead of the caller's factories and
hands the list down into core, which never imports them. MISAKA also builds sessions
from inside core -- a card under the daemon, a sub-agent child -- where the bundled
package cannot be imported without core referring to it. So the entry assigns the
composition function into ``misaka.core.wiring.bundled`` instead, and core calls it
with each session's spec. Every process entry calls ``install`` first: the CLI
(``misaka.cli.app``), the sub-agent child (``misaka.cli.subagent_child``) and the
research node (``misaka.cli.research_node``). A process that never runs an entry -- a
bare kernel run in a test -- builds sessions without bundled extensions.

``install`` is also where a process refuses to start on a settings.json knob it cannot
use, listing every one at once, so a bad value is found before any work begins rather
than by whichever long-running process reads it first.
