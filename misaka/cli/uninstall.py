"""``misaka uninstall``: remove what this install put on the machine, and nothing else.

The counterpart to ``misaka setup``, shaped after Hermes's uninstaller in intent rather than detail:

- **The program and your data are separate choices, and the default keeps the data**, so a
  reinstall picks up where you left off. ``--full`` removes both; ``--data`` removes only the data.
- **Everything that would go is listed first**, and ``--dry-run`` stops there. That includes what
  MISAKA left outside its home: links on the PATH that point into it (tools an agent installed
  under ``shared/``), and what a project's ``.misaka/`` holds that MISAKA derived (a plugin's store).
- **Before data goes, a backup archive is offered** (``cli.backup``): the home less its caches,
  logs and sockets, kept outside it.
- **Running work is not cut off**: an active research run, a card, or a session open in the panel
  refuses the command until it is finished or closed.
- **The program is removed with the tool that installed it** (``uv tool``, pipx, pip), as the
  last step, since it is the code this command runs from.

Never touched: a project's own content, the configuration a person wrote into its ``.misaka/``
(``settings.json``, ``subagents/``, ...), and a source checkout, which is a repository of yours.
