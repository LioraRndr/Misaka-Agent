"""``misaka update``: is this install behind the repository, and what would bring it level.

Shaped after how Hermes updates itself, in intent rather than detail. Follow the branch head
rather than release tags, fast-forward only, and never guess: refuse on a dirty tree, a diverged
branch, or an install shape it cannot vouch for, and say what to run by hand. Checking and applying
are separate (``hermes update --check``); nothing here runs on its own. Applying keeps Hermes's
promises too:

- the install method decides the command, and what the install holds survives it: uv and pipx
  upgrade from their own records, extras included; pip is handed the extras found installed;
- running work is not cut off: an active research run or a card in a pane refuses the update,
  and a panel with sessions open is left running for its owner to restart;
- before anything changes, the settings, credentials and state databases are copied aside
  (``cli.backup``), because a code rollback is not a data rollback;
- the updated code must start. When it cannot, a checkout is put back where it was; any other
  install is told the command that puts it back.

How the install was made is read, not guessed: PEP 610 writes ``direct_url.json`` into the
dist-info, ``INSTALLER`` records which tool did it, and uv and pipx leave a receipt in the
environment they manage.
