"""A blocked event loop becomes a stack trace -- and, in a process nobody is watching, an exit.

Every MISAKA process does its work on one asyncio loop. Synchronous code that never returns on it
(GitHub issue #10: the live-skill guard looping forever before a bash call) freezes everything
that process does -- heartbeats, leases, the TUI -- and nothing inside the process can notice,
because noticing needs the loop. ``faulthandler``'s watchdog is a C thread that needs neither the
loop nor the GIL: the running loop re-arms it every ``STALL_SECONDS / 4``, and if no loop re-arms
it, it writes every thread's stack to ``logs/stalls/<label>-<pid>.log`` -- and, in a process that
exits on a stall (an unattended card, node or sub-agent), ends it with status 1, which every
supervisor already treats as a crashed attempt and retries. A log with no stall in it is removed
when its process ends, and logs older than ``KEEP_DAYS`` when the next process starts.

Nothing happens until a process entry calls :func:`configure`; library code and tests are
untouched. Whichever loop is running re-arms the one timer, so ``run_coro``'s nested loop (whose
caller's loop is waiting on it) keeps the watch going. Known limit: with two loops alive in two
threads, the live one keeps re-arming while the other is frozen. A process stopped from outside
(SIGSTOP, a debugger) for longer than the limit is taken for stalled when it continues: the C timer
counts the stopped time and fires before any Python code runs. The TUI's own Ctrl+Z disarms first
(:func:`suspend`).
